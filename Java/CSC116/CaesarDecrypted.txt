Chapter 1

Caesar, advancing by moderate journeys, and continuing his march without intermission,
arrived at Lilybaeum, on the 14th day before the calends of January. Designing to 
embark immediately, though he had only one legion of new levies, and not quite six 
hundred horse, he ordered his tent to be pitched so near the sea-side that the waves 
lashed the very foot of it. This he did with a view that none should think he had time
to delay, and that his men might be kept in readiness at a day or an hour's warning. 
Though the wind at that time was contrary, he nevertheless detained the soldiers and 
mariners on board, that he might lose no opportunity of sailing; the rather, because 
the forces of the enemy were announced by the inhabitants of the province, to consist 
of innumberable cavalry not to be numbered; four legions headed by Juba, together with 
a great body of light-armed troops; ten legions under the command of Scipio; a hundred
and twenty elephants, and fleets in abundance. Yet he was not alarmed, nor lost his 
confident hopes and spirits. Meantime the number of galleys and transports increased 
daily; the new-levied legions flocked in to him from all parts; among the rest the 
fifth, a veteran legion, and about two thousand horse.
